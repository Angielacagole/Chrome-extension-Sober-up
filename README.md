## Warining

As this project is the one of the firsts since i started coding, there are few aspects needing improvement. 
Sometimes it could show alcohol pictures, for instance in the google page research where the first part is dedicated to commercial link to purchase, as its automatically generated by google. Or it could also hide pictures that are not alcohol related if their "<alt" contain a word of the list to trigger like "gin", "vin"...
